# Google Books Search Engine

## Description
In this challenge, the task was to refactor a fully functional Google Books API search engine built using a RESTful API into a GraphQL API utilizing Apollo Server. The application features a React frontend, a MongoDB database, and a Node.js/Express.js server and API. The primary goal was to implement GraphQL queries and mutations for data retrieval and modification, replacing the existing RESTful endpoints. Additionally, the existing authentication middleware had to be adjusted to function within the context of the GraphQL API. The final step involved creating an Apollo Provider to enable effective communication between the frontend and the Apollo Server.
